- changing a file in the editor causes the file to be saved
- changing a file in the file system causes the editor be changed
- deleting a file in the file system causes the tab to be closed
- contents of file in separate windows stay synced
- changes are saved when a tab or window is closed
  - saving should be done globally... saving files individually
    is just weird
  - although there is a 3-second delay to saving when you are
    modifying the buffer, there should be no delay when you close
    the last tab of a file
