end key should work
ctrl+home and ctrl+end
pgdown, pgup (careful not to go past end of file)
support selection (shift+arrow/(ctrl+)home/(ctrl+)end/pgdown/pgup)
cut, copy, paste
mouse click should reposition cursor
mouse drag should select
undo/redo?
cabalify? (maybe later; will probably still need heavy modification, for things like jump to line; find line to make red, syntax high-lighting, etc)
fix scrollToCursor
